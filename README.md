Solar Panel Capstone
==============================
The goal of this project is to use data from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Tracking the Sun 
dataset to model which features maximize the cost efficiency of a solar panel installation in the state
of Texas. The data has been reduced to residential installations performed in 2020 and 2021 only in order
to develop a model designed for homeowner adoption of solar panels.
